# EKF-Robot-Localization
Implementing EKF Localization to solve a robot localization problem using Python. 
Tasks to be undertaken:

•	Implementing EKF Localization to solve a robot localization problem using Python.
•	Testing, justification and detailed critical analysis of your approach in a report and give presentation.

•	Attention is given to:
◦	State transition matrix (Ak), which is a jacobian matrix. This is also denoted by Fk in some literatures, including in this coursework.
◦	Process noise covariance matrix (Qk).
◦	Measurement (observation) matrix (Hk), which is a jacobian matrix.
◦	Observation noise covariance matrix (Rk).
◦	Effective implementation using Python.
◦	Proper understanding of each component of the EKF localisation.
◦	Analysis of correlation of states in a state vector using updated covariance from the last time step.
◦	Detailed critical analysis of the problem and the results in the report, etc.
◦	You also need to fine-tune the necessary parameters for better as well as bad localization, such as Qk, Rk, the noise ratio added to control input, and the noise ratio added to observation. You need to investigate under varying conditions: better and bad results, and why they happened. You also need to support your result analysis with visualization.
